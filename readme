project 1 :a simple HTTP client application that can upload request to server

project 2: a simple HTTP server application and use it with off-the-shelf HTTP clients

project 3:re-implement the HTTP client and the HTTP remote file manager of project #1 and #2 respectively using UDP protocol.
         In the previous projects, we leverage TCP protocol for implementation to guarantee packet transmission over unreliable
         network links. Because we are going to use UDP protocol that does not guarantee the transfer, we need to insure reliability 
         by implementing a specific instance of the Automatic-Repeat-Request (ARQ) protocol called: Selective Repeat ARQ / Selective Reject
         ARQ. Before starting on this Lab, we encourage you to review the programming samples and the associated course materials.
